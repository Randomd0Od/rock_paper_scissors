# Rock Paper Scissors
My first big project using JavaScript.
### My personal objectives:
- Breaking down the project one function at a time
- Making sure each function works before moving on the next
- Keep it simple by not letting the code 'run away' from me and get out of hand
- Not to worry about looks, but functionality
