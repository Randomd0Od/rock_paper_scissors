# Rock Paper Scissors
My first big project using JavaScript, making a simple game of user against the computer.
### My personal objectives:
- Breaking down the project one function at a time
- Making sure each function works before moving on the next
- Keep it simple by not letting the code 'run away' from me and get out of hand
- Not to worry about looks, but functionality
- ...but still keep it clean
### Project objectives:
- [x] Show results successfully through 'console' mode
- [x] Randomized choice for computer
- [x] Working game for one round
- [x] Working game for 5 rounds, w/ counter
- [x] Show overall winner / loser after 5 rounds
- [ ] Show tally of who's winning / losing
### Goals achieved:
- ~Works for single round, refresh / F5 for repeat playability~
- Game now plays through 5 rounds successfully
- ~Computer (comp.) sort of random~
- Computer is randomized
- ~Results shown through console mode~
- ALL results (except for player input) are now shown in console
### Problems solved
- When the player was placed first in the script, the results ended in more draws.  Switching the order, with the computer placed first in making it's choice, the results are more randomized.
- For visually neater display of each round's result, I opted to stack the outcomes line by line, which required coding it in `template literal`, which really does mean **literal**, what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG).
