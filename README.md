# Rock Paper Scissors
My first big project using JavaScript, making a simple game of user against the computer.
### My personal objectives:
- Breaking down the project one function at a time
- Making sure each function works before moving on the next
- Keep it simple by not letting the code 'run away' from me and get out of hand
- Not to worry about looks, but functionality
- ...but still keep it clean
### Project objectives:
- Show results successfully through 'console' mode
- Randomized choice for computer
- Working game for one round
### Goals achieved:
- Works for single round, refresh / F5 for repeat playability
- Opponent (comp.) sort of random
- Results shown through console mode
-
